joins optimization
===================

When working with big data (millions of rows), directly joining large tables can slow down performance.

This happens because Spark needs to **shuffle** data across partitions and nodes to match join keys, which uses a lot of memory, CPU, and network.

To improve join performance:
- Use **repartition** on join keys
- Use **broadcast join** if one table is small
   

üîÑ What is Shuffling in Spark?

Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across different partitions in a Spark cluster so that related records are grouped together based on a specific key (like emp_id). 
It typically occurs during wide transformations such as join, groupBy, and distinct. 



üí° Why is Shuffling Important Before a Join?

In Spark, data is divided into multiple partitions and distributed across executors. 
When performing a join between two datasets (like employees and department), Spark must ensure that rows with the same join key (emp_id) are in the same partition. 

If shuffling is not done:
- A row with emp_id = 101 in the employees table (Partition 1) might need to match with a row in the department table (Partition 2).
- Spark processes partitions independently, so it cannot match these rows unless they are shuffled into the same partition.

üö® Without Shuffling:
- Spark may attempt to match data across partitions, causing high network I/O and degraded performance.

‚úÖ With Shuffling:
- Spark applies hashPartition(emp_id) to redistribute the data.
- Matching emp_id values are sent to the same partition.
- Joins become more efficient because each executor only works on local data without needing cross-partition communication.

üìå Summary:
Shuffling is critical before performing joins in Spark. 
It ensures that matching keys are colocated in the same partition, enabling faster and more efficient join execution.

broadcast join optimization
============================

‚ùå Problem with hash partition joins:
When joining two tables, Spark typically uses hashPartition(emp_id) to shuffle data and bring matching keys together. 
This works well, but if **Table T1 is significantly larger than Table T2**, or **Table T2 is larger than T1**, shuffling causes:

- High network I/O (data movement across nodes)
- Increased memory and CPU usage
- Slower performance

‚úÖ Why broadcast join is better here:
If one table (like department) is small, Spark can broadcast it to all executors.
This avoids shuffling the large table (employee), allowing the join to be done locally and much faster.

üìå In a broadcast join, the small table (department) is replicated and sent to all executors. 
This avoids shuffling the large table (employee). Each executor performs the join locally, 
processing its own portion of the employee table against the full department table.
